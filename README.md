# jekyllblog
I created a simple blog using Jekyll and SASS.

To start editing files with Jekyll:
1. Install Jekyll (Open up your Console!)
 $ gem install jekyll

2. Navigate to your blog folder
$ cd desktop/jekyllblog

3. Build your site
$ jekyll build

4. Run Jekyll
$ jekyll serve

To edit the CSS files using SASS:
1. Navigate to your folder in the console
$ cd desktop/jekyllblog/css

2. Have SASS watch the .scss file for changes
$ sass --watch main.scss:main.css

This project was meant to teach myself how to use Jekyll.
